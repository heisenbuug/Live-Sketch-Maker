## Anaconda Navigator & Spyder

Anaconda Navigator is a desktop graphical user interface included in Anaconda that allows you to launch applications and easily manage conda packages, environments and channels without the need to use command line commands.

Spyder is a powerful interactive development environment for the Python language with advanced editing, interactive testing, debugging and introspection features. Additionally, Spyder is a numerical computing environment thanks to the support of IPython and popular Python libraries such as NumPy, SciPy, or matplotlib.

## OpenCV

OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is released under a BSD license and hence itâ€™s free for both academic and commercial use. It has C++, Python and Java interfaces and supports Windows, Linux, Mac OS, iOS and Android. OpenCV was designed for computational efficiency and with a strong focus on real-time applications. Written in optimized C/C++, the library can take advantage of multi-core processing. Enabled with OpenCL, it can take advantage of the hardware acceleration of the underlying heterogeneous compute platform.
